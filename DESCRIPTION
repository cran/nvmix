Title: Multivariate Normal Variance Mixtures
Description: Functions for working with (grouped) multivariate normal variance mixture
  distributions (evaluation of distribution functions and densities,
  random number generation and parameter estimation), including
  Student's t distribution for non-integer degrees-of-freedom as well as the grouped t
  distribution and copula with multiple degrees-of-freedom parameters.
  See <doi:10.18637/jss.v102.i02> for a high-level description of select functionality.
